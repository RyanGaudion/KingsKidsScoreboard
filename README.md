# KingsKidsScoreboard
Basic 2 Player Scoreboard written in python


I have included 2 versions of my code to github, KingsKids.py and KingsKidsGlobal.py:

    
KingsKids.py --> Basic 2 player scoreboard
KingsKIdsGlobal.py --> 2 player scoreboard with score http server

Pillow is needed to run the program:

    pip install Pillow

To compile it yourself you need to install cx_freeze:

    python -m pip install cx_Freeze --upgrade
 
To compile  make sure to have the Kings-Kids.png image in the correct folder.

Then run the command:

    python setup.py install
    
Download the new version with server here:
